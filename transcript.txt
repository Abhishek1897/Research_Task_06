AI-Generated Synthetic Interview (Transcript)
---------------------------------------------

Host: Coach, looking back at last season—what stands out?
Coach: We played 19 games and learned a lot about our pacing and finishing.

Host: If you wanted two more wins next season, where’s the lever—offense or defense?
Coach: Offense. Sharper shot selection and turnovers matter most for us. Emma Ward profiles as our offensive game-changer.

Host: Who took the biggest step forward?
Coach: Joely Caramelli—more points, fewer turnovers, stronger on draws and ground balls.

Host: There was chatter about late-game dips. Real?
Coach: Yes. We scored 74 in first periods but 47 in fourths. We’ll train for late-game decision-making and fatigue.

Host: Any neutral-site quirks?
Coach: None—we didn’t play neutral-site games last season.

Host: And pure efficiency—who led?
Coach: Emma Ward—highest (G+A−TO) metric on the roster.

Host: Thanks, coach—looking forward to seeing those late-game reps pay off.
